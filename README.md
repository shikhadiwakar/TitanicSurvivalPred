# Titanic Survival Prediction Flask App

This repository contains a Flask web application that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on their demographic information. The prediction model is trained using the Titanic dataset and a logistic regression algorithm. Users can input passenger details such as Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and Embarked, and the app will provide a prediction of whether the passenger would have survived or not.

## Features
Interactive web interface for predicting Titanic survival chances.
Logistic regression model trained on the Titanic dataset.
User-friendly form for inputting passenger details.
Clear visualization of prediction results.
